------------------

6.2.0 (2018-07-03)
------------------

**Backwards incompatible change** - ``DocType`` refactoring.

In ``6.2.0`` we refactored the ``DocType`` class and renamed it to
``Document``. The primary motivation for this was the support for types being
dropped from elasticsearch itself in ``7.x`` - we needed to somehow link the
``Index`` and ``Document`` classes. To do this we split the options that were
previously defined in the ``class Meta`` between it and newly introduced
``class Index``. The split is that all options that were tied to mappings (like
setting ``dynamic = MetaField('strict')``) remain in ``class Meta`` and all
options for index definition (like ``settings``, ``name``, or ``aliases``) got
moved to the new ``class Index``.

You can see some examples of the new functionality in the ``examples``
directory. Documentation has been updated to reflect the new API.

``DocType`` is now just an alias for ``Document`` which will be removed in
``7.x``. It does, however, work in the new way which is not fully backwards
compatible.

* ``Percolator`` field now expects ``Query`` objects as values
* you can no longer access meta fields on a ``Document`` instance by specifying
  ``._id`` or similar. Instead all access needs to happen via the ``.meta``
  attribute.
* Implemented ``NestedFacet`` for ``FacetedSearch``. This brought a need to
  slightly change the semantics of ``Facet.get_values`` which now expects the
  whole data dict for the aggregation, not just the ``buckets``. This is
  a backwards incompatible change for custom aggregations that redefine that
  method.
* ``Document.update`` now supports ``refresh`` kwarg
* ``DslBase._clone`` now produces a shallow copy, this means that modifying an
  existing query can have effects on existing ``Search`` objects.
* Empty ``Search`` no longer defaults to ``match_all`` query and instead leaves
  the ``query`` key empty. This is backwards incompatible when using
  ``suggest``.

6.1.0 (2018-01-09)
------------------

* Removed ``String`` field.
* Fixed issue with ``Object``/``Nested`` deserialization

6.0.1 (2018-01-02)
------------------

Fixing wheel package for Python 2.7 (#803)

6.0.0 (2018-01-01)
------------------

Backwards incompatible release compatible with elasticsearch 6.0, changes
include:

 * use ``doc`` as default ``DocType`` name, this change includes:
   * ``DocType._doc_type.matches`` method is now used to determine which
   ``DocType`` should be used for a hit instead of just checking ``_type``
 * ``Nested`` and ``Object`` field refactoring using newly introduced
   ``InnerDoc`` class. To define a ``Nested``/``Object`` field just define the
   ``InnerDoc`` subclass and then use it when defining the field::

      class Comment(InnerDoc):
          body = Text()
          created_at = Date()

      class Blog(DocType):
          comments = Nested(Comment)

 * methods on ``connections`` singleton are now exposed on the ``connections``
   module directly.
 * field values are now only deserialized when coming from elasticsearch (via
   ``from_es`` method) and not when assigning values in python (either by
   direct assignment or in ``__init__``).

5.4.0 (2017-12-06)
------------------
 * fix ``ip_range`` aggregation and rename the class to ``IPRange``.
   ``Iprange`` is kept for bw compatibility

 * ``IndexTemplate`` can now be specified using the same API as ``Index``
 * ``Boolean`` field now accepts ``"false"`` as ``False``

------------------
 * fix constant score query definition
 * ``DateHistogramFacet`` now works with ``datetime`` objects
 * respect ``__`` in field names when creating queries from dict

5.2.0 (2017-03-26)
------------------
 * make sure all response structers are pickleable (for caching)
 * adding ``exclude`` to ``Search``
 * fix metric aggregation deserialization

 * adding ``delete`` to ``Search`` which calls ``delete_by_query`` API

5.1.0 (2017-01-08)
------------------
 * Renamed ``Result`` and ``ResultMeta`` to ``Hit`` and ``HitMeta`` respectively
 * ``Response`` now stores ``Search`` which it gets as first arg to ``__init__``
 * aggregation results are now wrapped in classes and properly deserialized

------------------
 * ``inner_hits`` are now also wrapped in ``Response``

2.0.0 (2016-02-18)
------------------

 * Filters have been removed and additional queries have been added. Instead of
   ``F`` objects you can now use ``Q``.
 * ``Search.filter`` is now just a shortcut to add queries in filter context
 * support for pipeline aggregations added

Backwards incompatible changes:

 * list of analysis objects and classes was removed, any string used as
   tokenizer, char or token filter or analyzer will be treated as a builtin
 * internal method ``Field.to_python`` has been renamed to ``deserialize`` and
   an optional serialization mechanic for fields has been added.

   kwarg to ``Search.execute``
