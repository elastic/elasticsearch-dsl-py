"""
Complex data model example modeling data from stackoverflow.

It is used to showcase several key features of elasticsearch-dsl:

    * Object and Nested fields: see User and Comment classes and fields they
      are used in

    * Parent/Child relationship

        * See the Join field on Post creating the relationship between Question
          and Answer

        * Meta.matches allows the hits from same index to be wrapped in proper
          classes

        * to see how child objects are created see Question.add_answer

        * Question.search_answers shows how to query for children of a
          particular parent

    * Index management

        * This code expects an index per site, all managed by a single template
          which is created in setup function. Run this as you would a function
          responsible for managing your db schema - at every deploy of new
          code.

        * An index object for any site can be created via get_index function.
          If you don't specify which site you wish to use the current one
          (defined in CURRENT_SITE constant) will be returned.

        * base_search helper is there to construct a Search object for current
          site
